[![.github/workflows/build.yml](https://github.com/primacydotco/Ylmish/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/primacydotco/Ylmish/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Real-time, collaborative apps with a delightful programming model.

Here lie libraries for integrating [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) and [Elmish](https://github.com/elmish/elmish), via [Fable](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable) and [Adaptive](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Data.Adaptive).

> 😸 I like building apps with Elmish, I like sharing state with Yjs. Let's conjugate!
> 
> I want (select) changes to an Elmish model to propagate to a Yjs document, and changes to a Yjs document to reflect in the Elmish model.

## Background

### Data and communication

Our **app data** describes what is in memory while our app is running. Our **state data** describes what is persisted in browser storage and synchronized with peers.

Changes need to be communicated bi-directionally. That is, any changes made to **state data**, in Yjs, need to be made to **app data**, in Elmish, and (some) changes made to app data (such as through interactions with the app) need to be made to state data.

If we were to observe a running [**Elmish** loop](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/#dispatch-loop), we wouldn't see the operations being applied to the app's model. They're opaque to an observer because they're inside the `update` functions. Instead, we only have access to each successive `'model`, that is, the consequence of operations.

> For example, an Elmish `'model` may contain a list and an interaction may add two items into that list, but from the outside, we only see the new list, not two 'add' operations.

If we observe a **Yjs** document, we'd see all of the operations that occur and those are shared with peers for synchronization.

> For example, a Yjs `Y.Array` and an interaction may add two items to that array and from the outside, we can observe two add operations. (And we can combine all the operations to see the 'current' state of the array.)

We need to bridge these two worlds, that is, we need to be able to go from our changes represented as successive models to our changes represented as the operations themselves.

```
'model -> 'model -> 'operations
# which looks just like a classic differencing (diffing) function...
'document -> 'document -> 'delta
```

['Incremental computation'](https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous/issues/258#issue-391515540) has already been used where people want to build apps that use immutable data structures but performantly update a mutable DOM. Part of this work has been to [efficiently](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/768) diff two models.

**Design**

We bridge Elmish and Yjs through an intermediate, incremental model using [FSharp.Data.Adaptive](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Data.Adaptive) (an fsharp implementation of incremental computing) and [Adaptify](https://github.com/krauthaufen/Adaptify) (to incrementalize an existing Elmish model). 

Successive Elmish models are used to update the incremental model. The (calculated) changes to the incremental model are observed and (the deltas) are applied to the Yjs document.

```
┌─Elmish─┐         ┌─Adaptive─────────┐         ┌─Yjs───┐
│        │ --[1]-> │                  │ --[2]-> │       │
│ Model  │         │ IncrementalModel │         │ Y.Doc │
│        │ <-[4]-- │                  | <-[3]-- │       │
└────────┘         └──────────────────┘         └───────┘
App data                                    State data

Using Ylmish.Program.withYlmish:
[1] Successive Elmish models are used to update the incremental model.
[2] Changes to the incremental model are observed and (the deltas) are applied to the Yjs document.
[3] Changes to the Yjs document are observed and the deltas are applied to the incremental model
[4] Changes to the incremental model are observed and a updated Elmish model is set for each.
```

### Schema and codec

Our **app schema** describes the structure of our app data, that is, what is in memory while our app is running. Our **state schema** describes the structure of our state data, that is, what is persisted in browser storage and synchronized with peers via the app's companion.

Our state schema _must_ be decoupled from our app schema because:

1. Our app schema will change over time as our app changes. The state schema must be protected from breaking changes to the app schema.
   So, we need an anti-corruption layer between the two schemas.
1. Only a subset of app data needs to be persisted.
   So, we need to be able to select what should be persisted.

If we have this decoupling, we need an explicit description of how our app schema translates to our state schema and vice versa. We need to be able to _encode_ that app data as state data and _decode_ state data into app data.

**Design**

We provide `Ylmish.Adaptive.Codec` for writing encoders and decoders. 

```
┌─Adaptive─────────────────────────────────┐
│ AdaptiveModel --[1]-> AMap<string, AVal> │
│                                          │
│ AVal<Model>   <-[2]-- AMap<string, AVal> |
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
App schema                      State schema

Using Ylmish.Adaptive.Codec:
[1] .Encoder
[2] .Decoder
```


## TODO


1. Investigate failing `Ylmish.Adaptive.Codec.roundtrip updates` test.

1. Implement adaptive-to-Y attaching (syncing), but separate directions

	Right now `Y.Text.attach` sets up bi-directional sync. This should be separated into single directions so that encoding can work with different schemas to decoding which is important for when schemas change over time.

	1. Write a test for the motivator of this change, that is
		1. ~~ensuring existing (state data) maps aren't overwritten~~
		1. ~~ensuring new maps can be added from the app data~~
	   Added to tests in  `Program.fs`
	1. Find another way to handle the sentinel thingo so it doesn't get into a loop. (Ideally considering running multi-threaded in .NET, though minimally we could just assume single-threaded JS for now.)

1. Implement the actual attaching of the adaptive model to the Y.Doc in Program.withYlmish so that the tests in Program.withYlmish pass.

1. Ylmish.Adaptive.Codec.Decoders will need access to the Elmish model.

   The app data will have elements not persisted by state data. (For example, data that is only relevant to current interactions or the current session.) This app data needs to be retained through changes to state data.
   Therefore, when the developer writes a decoder they need access to the current Elmish model to express how app data and state data should be merged.

   `Decoder<'Element, 'Result>` is already a Reader monad so this might be accomplished by tupling the Elmish model into the `'Element` env parameter and implementing an 'ask' function to the `Decode.object` builder

1. We're using `doc.getMap ()` to get a Y.Map in our Program.fs tests. I'm guessing that doesn't get us a 'root' map though and that subsequent calls don't give us _the same_ map. (What does it give us?) We might need make the developer pass in a root map instead.

1. Consider get-or-insert semantics for nested Y types so our maps and arrays aren't overwritten by two clients initializing shared types.

   We could code around this it by only using top-level maps and arrays, representing nested types by name.
   For example, `Y.Doc.getMap('x.y.z')` to represent a map `z` inside a map `y` inside the top-level map `x`.
   Maybe the [key-value type] will support this?(https://github.com/yjs/yjs/issues/255).

1. ~~IndexList in FSharp.Data.Adaptive starts at 1 is probably why the Delta tests are failing~~ *Fixed by #2 and #3*

1. ~~Elmish has different versions for Fable and .NET. We need to use the right one.~~ *Fixed by #1*

   ~~https://github.com/elmish/elmish#using-elmish~~

1. Investigate supporting [Ycs](https://github.com/yjs/ycs) or [Yrs](https://github.com/y-crdt/y-crdt (with a FFI binding) (in addition to [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) (./src/Fable.Yjs)).

1. Some app data might need to be resolved with additional network requests.

   For example, the author ID might be persisted in the state data, but the author name and display image might be kept by a different service.

   It might be such a common case we should provide hooks in decoding to resolve this data. In the meantime, this could be left up to the user to do in the Elmish layer.
