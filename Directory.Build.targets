        Custom target which uses the Adaptify dotnet tool running in local mode.

        We use this instead of the Adaptify.MSBuild target for Fable compatibility:
        1. the Adaptify.MSBuild target:
            a. always runs in server mode
            b. works by generating files in the user's temp directory then adding them to the "Compile" itemgroup before
               "CoreCompile" runs
        2. Fable doesn't run custom targets when building - it just works out which files to build then builds them itself
        3. the "addtoproject" option adds generated files directly to the project file, but is only supported in local mode

        This target will be called automatically for the .NET build (because we set "BeforeTargets" to "CoreCompile").

        Look in ./package.json to see how we call this target when necessary for the Fable build.
